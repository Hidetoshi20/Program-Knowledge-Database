For those who want to know a little more about the innards of HTTP, the HTTP.Server class is actually an implementation of the TCP-based

Net.Server , which is covered in Chapter 7. TCP provides the transporta-tion layer, while HTTP provides the application layer.

The callback function used when responding to a web request supports two parameters: request and response. The second parameter, the response , is an object of type http.ServerReponse . Itâ€™s a *writable stream with support for* several functions, including response.writeHead() to create the response header, response.write() to write the response data, and response.end() , to end the response.
