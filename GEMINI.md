# Gemini Workspace

This file provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to understand the project and its goals.

## Project Overview

This is a personal knowledge base built with **MkDocs** and the **Material for MkDocs** theme. The goal is to create a well-organized and easily accessible repository of programming, networking, and database knowledge.

## Project Structure

The knowledge base is organized into the following main sections:

-   **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML
-   **Database Systems:** Covering database design, implementation, and management.
-   **Networking:** Following a computer networking top-down approach.
-   **Node.js:** Focusing on learning Node.js and server-side development.
-   **Web Front End:** Including browser technologies, web frameworks, security, and performance.
-   **Operating Systems:** Carrier OS.
-   **Web 3:** Areas to be explored in the Web 3 space.

All documentation is written in **Markdown** and is located in the `docs` directory.

## Development and Deployment

-   **Local Development:** The site can be served locally using the command `mkdocs serve`.
-   **Deployment:** The site is automatically deployed to **GitHub Pages** using a **GitHub Actions workflow**. This workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and is triggered on any push to the `main` branch.

## Writing Guidelines

To support my goal of learning English technical terms, please adhere to the following convention when creating or updating documents:

-   **Primary Language for Terms**: All professional and technical terms should be written in **English** first.
-   **Supplementary Chinese**: The corresponding Chinese translation should follow in parentheses `()`.
-   **Example**: `This is a repository (仓库) for...`
-   **Rich Content**: Use **Mermaid charts** and **tables** frequently to visually explain concepts and data.
-   **Document Structure**: Prefer larger, well-structured documents over many small, fragmented files. A good internal structure with clear headings is key to readability.
