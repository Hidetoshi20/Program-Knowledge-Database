# Gemini Workspace

This file provides context for the Gemini AI assistant to understand the project and its goals.

## Project Overview

This is a personal knowledge base built with MkDocs and the Material for MkDocs theme. The goal is to create a well-organized and easily accessible repository of programming, networking, and database knowledge.

## Project Structure

The knowledge base is organized into the following main sections:

-   **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, HTML
-   **Database Systems:** Database design, implementation, and management
-   **Networking:** Computer networking concepts, with a top-down approach
-   **Node.js:** Learning Node.js and server-side development
-   **Web Front End:** Browser technologies, web frameworks, security, and performance
-   **Operating Systems:** Carrier OS
-   **Web 3:** Areas to be explored in the Web 3 space

The documentation is written in Markdown and is located in the `docs` directory.

## Development and Deployment

-   **Local Development:** The site can be served locally using `mkdocs serve`.
-   **Deployment:** The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml` and is triggered on pushes to the `main` branch.
