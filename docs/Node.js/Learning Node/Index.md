### A note on the digital index

A link in an index entry is displayed as the section title in which that entry appears. Because some sections have multiple index markers, it is not unusual for an entry to have several links to the same section. Clicking on any link will take you directly to the place in the text in which the marker appears.

About the Author

Shelley Powers has been working with, and writing about, web technologies--from the first release of JavaScript to the latest graphics and design tools--for more than 12 years. Her recent O'Reilly books have covered the semantic web, Ajax, JavaScript, and web graphics. She's an avid amateur photographer and web development aficionado, who enjoys applying her latest experiments on her many web sites.

Colophon

The animal on the cover of *Learning Node* is a hamster rat (*Beamys*). There are two species of hamster rats: the greater hamster rat (*Beamys major*) and the lesser hamster rat (*Beamys hindei*).

The hamster rat inhabits the African forests from Kenya to Tanzania. This large rodent prefers to make its home in moist environments: along riverbanks and in thickly-forested areas. It thrives in coastal or mountainous regions, although deforestation threatens its natural habitat. Hamster rats live in multichambered burrows and are excellent climbers.

This rodent has a very distinct appearance: it can be 7 to 12 inches long and weigh up to a third of a pound. It has a short head and gray fur overall, with a white belly and a mottled black and white tail. The hamster rat, like other rodents, has a variable diet; it possesses cheek pouches for food storage.

The cover image is from *Shaw’s Zoology*. The cover font is Adobe ITC Garamond. The text font is Linotype Birka; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is LucasFont’s TheSansMonoCondensed.
